# The Code Quiz

## Description 

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- By creating this quiz, I can show off my ability of programming variables, loops, and control structures for future employers.
- JavaScript allows you to create quizzes that are more interactive and engaging for users. For example, you can use JavaScript to create quizzes that include images, videos, or other interactive elements.
- What problem does it solve?  Javascript allows access on a variety of devices and platforms, including computers, tablets, and smartphones.
- JavaScript is commonly used for web development, so creating a quiz in JavaScript helped me learn web development skills such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and DOM manipulation.
